# Flight Validation Model with Capture Mechanism in Simulink

This Simulink flight model is built specifically to replicate the dynamic performance of the SG 15L FPV drone used in our drone-interceptor project. The primary purpose of the flight model is to accurately simulate the droneâ€™s flight characteristics, enabling predictions and evaluations of how the addition of the designed capture mechanism, introducing extra mass and altered inertia, will affect overall flight performance. By assessing factors such as roll, pitch, and yaw stability thresholds and identifying potential points of flight failure, the flight model provides essential insights into the viability and limitations of the drone-capture system under realistic operational conditions.
